Doodle Interpreter is a lightweight, sketch-based mood journaling system.
Users draw freely on a canvas, and the system analyzes stroke features—color, complexity, energy, and shapes—to generate a warm, journal-style reflection using an LLM.
All entries are saved per-day in a calendar, allowing users to revisit past doodles, reflections, and moods.
The goal is to explore low-barrier, expressive interaction in HCI by turning simple doodles into meaningful emotional insights.
